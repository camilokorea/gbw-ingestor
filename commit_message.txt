refactor: Make country codes configurable in appsettings.template.json

Moves the hardcoded list of country codes from `QueueSeederService.cs` to `appsettings.template.json` under a new `CountriesToSeed` section.

- **`src/Worker/appsettings.template.json`:**
  - Adds a new `CountriesToSeed` array containing the full list of country codes.
  - Removes the no-longer-needed `Ingestion:Regions` section.

- **`src/Application/Services/QueueSeederService.cs`:**
  - Modifies the constructor to inject `IConfiguration`.
  - Updates the `SeedQueueAsync` method to retrieve the list of country codes from `_configuration.GetSection("CountriesToSeed")`.
  - Removes the static `GetAllCountryCodes()` method, as the data is now externalized.

This change improves flexibility, allowing the list of countries to be managed and updated without requiring code recompilation and redeployment.
