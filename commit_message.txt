fix: Resolve build errors in Application project

Adds missing NuGet package references to the `eBird.Ingestor.Application.csproj` file to resolve build errors related to `IConfiguration` and its extension methods.

- **`src/Application/eBird.Ingestor.Application.csproj`:**
  - Adds `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions` package reference (version 9.0.8) to enable the use of `IConfiguration` interface.
  - Adds `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder` package reference (version 9.0.8) to enable the use of `Get<T>()` extension method for configuration binding.

This commit addresses the compilation failures introduced by the previous refactoring that moved country code configuration to `appsettings.template.json` and utilized `IConfiguration` within the `Application` layer.
